# CNumberConverter
Converts numbers in one base to another base in c

# Files
To make working as a group easier, each section of conversion has been broken up into their own files.
Try to avoid working in `main.c` too much as multiple people doing things in `main.c` at the same time will cause conflicts.

# Working
To start your own work, create a branch. You can call it your name, or the specific conversion you're implementing or both.
Once you think you've finished all the work you might want on your branch, create a pull request and request me to review it.
I'll check for conflicts and push your code to main.

If someone elses work has been mereged into main recently, it's recommended that you pull main into your branch.
This isn't necessary but it can help to deal with conflicts along the way rather than all at once when you try and merge.
